# GPT-4 Text Originality Optimization Using PSO

This repository contains code snippets, generated sample texts, and evaluation statistics for the MSc AI thesis titled:

**"Tuning GPT-4 Generation Parameters Using Particle Swarm Optimization to Improve Text Originality and Coherence"**

## Folder Structure

- `1_first-tests/`: Early experiment outputs (manual and PSO)
- `2_bad-samples_clear-corpus/`: 50 low-quality examples from the CLEAR Corpus (manual + PSO) and their METEOR scores
- `3_good-samples_irish-news/`: 50 optimized examples from the Irish News dataset with evaluations
- `4_good-samples_clear-corpus/`: 50 optimized examples from the CLEAR Corpus with evaluations
- `datasets/`: Text file with links to external datasets used in the project

## File Format

All files are provided in `.docx` format for accessibility and fast reviewing. Each document contains source text, generated outputs (manual and PSO), and accompanying comments.

## About the Project

This work investigates whether tuning GPT-4’s temperature and response length using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can improve the originality of generated text while preserving coherence. METEOR scoring is used for quantitative evaluation.

## How to View the Files

All documents are provided in Microsoft Word format (.docx) for clarity and accessibility.  
You can preview them directly on GitHub or download for offline reading.

## Datasets

The project uses both a publicly available dataset and a custom-curated dataset:

- **CLEAR Corpus (Kaggle):** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/verracodeguacas/clear-corpus  
- **Irish News Dataset (custom):** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-7dmw9rlJrq54PA73_4_PrWE9Frtb8-?usp=sharing
